## 👨‍💻 About Me

In addition to coding, I'm passionate about continuous learning and keeping up with the latest technology trends. When I'm not building software, I enjoy reading about tech innovations and experimenting with new programming languages. I enjoy playing team-building video games like Call of Duty Warzone (PlayStation) and Call of Duty Mobile, which also helps me sharpen my collaboration and problem-solving skills.
